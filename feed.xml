Before you take big 
rewarding risks, it’s a good idea to have good risk management in 
place. Crypto is a good example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;three-times-bitcoin-lost-70-of-its-value&quot;&gt;Three times Bitcoin lost 70% of its value&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even including the current bear market, Crypto is clearly one of these big 
rewarding risks. Take Bitcoin as an example, since 2011, it’s been averaging
 yearly returns
around [XXX], for a volatility of [XXX], neglecting the risk-free rate,&lt;br /&gt;
that’s a Sharpe of  [XXX]. As 
a comparison, the average Sharpe of the SP500 over the last 20 years is [XXX].
The sharpe of Nasdaq from 1993 to 2000 was [XXX].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch is that Crypto also gets very large drawdowns. In fact, since 
2011, there have been three times where Bitcoin lost at least 70% of its value.
In the last two crashes, from [XXX] to [XXX], and [XXX] to [XXX] bitcoin 
actually lost  more than 90% of its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it very hard for any one to invest a serious share of their 
portfolio in Crypto. From an emotional perspective, it’s easy enough to HODL 
when you got your crypto for dirt cheap, in the early days of mining. It’s 
much harder when you’re investing savings accumulated over years of hard 
work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any risk management in place, the money you invest needs to be 
money you can afford to lose entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
